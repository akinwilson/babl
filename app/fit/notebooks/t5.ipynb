The Arabic term is in origin a corruption of Sanskrit jīvā , or `` chord '' . Sanskrit jīvā in learned usage was a synonym of jyā `` chord '' , originally the term for `` bow - string '' . Sanskrit jīvā was rendered into Arabic as jiba . This term was then transformed into the genuine Arabic word jayb , meaning `` bosom , fold , bay '' , either by the Arabs or by a mistake of the European translators such as Robert of Chester ( perhaps because the words were written without vowels ) , who translated jayb into Latin as sinus . Particularly Fibonacci 's sinus rectus arcus proved influential in establishing the term sinus . The words `` minute '' and `` second '' are derived from the Latin phrases partes minutae primae and partes minutae secundae . These roughly translate to `` first small parts '' and `` second small parts '' . </P> </s>\",\"question: who led the army that defeated the aztecs  context: <P> Cortés 's conquest has been depicted in numerous television documentaries .
