# Serving models 

## Overview 
FastAPI has been used to wrap an application server around our trained language models allowing their endpoints to be tested via an interactive API Documentation page. 

## Usage 
To develop upon the API, run 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To run the server in development mode, run 
```
fastapi dev api/main.py
```
