## Remote deployment 

## Overview 

This repository contains the infrastructure as code to provision an [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/ec2/?gclid=CjwKCAiAneK8BhAVEiwAoy2HYRJ80Nf5rCxwkctj5RfldsFhHREjb7a2I3d1mB2irtQkLJnRmlUmwBoCMXoQAvD_BwE&trk=c49c9dff-8619-4ee1-8d47-8585eb10c61e&sc_channel=ps&ef_id=CjwKCAiAneK8BhAVEiwAoy2HYRJ80Nf5rCxwkctj5RfldsFhHREjb7a2I3d1mB2irtQkLJnRmlUmwBoCMXoQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!638364387973!e!!g!!ec2!19090032168!140900569821)  on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?gclid=CjwKCAiAneK8BhAVEiwAoy2HYarfGp5s2zmOntzYKVk4GZzDUoqVBT_OTMyRcaph4714VAcTKDzgvBoCGH0QAvD_BwE&trk=d5254134-67ca-4a35-91cc-77868c97eedd&sc_channel=ps&ef_id=CjwKCAiAneK8BhAVEiwAoy2HYarfGp5s2zmOntzYKVk4GZzDUoqVBT_OTMyRcaph4714VAcTKDzgvBoCGH0QAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!433803620858!e!!g!!aws!1680401428!67152600164) to allow for the fitting job of deep learning models to occur remotely rather than locally.

Deep learning models may be train via two execution providers; the [CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit) or [GPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit). Both have their advantages and drawbacks. 



With using the CPU, as long as your available amount of [RAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory) memory  permits loading the model into memory with enough leeway to account for additional gradient parameters to be stored during fitting, you are able to train your deep learning models using it as an execution provider, that being at a considerable slower rate when compared to using the GPU as an execution provider. 

With using the GPU(s), you may see a substantial speed up in fitting time of your models, and your RAM memory requirements may shrink but this is at  the cost of requiring more [VRAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_random-access_memory), which on a per unit comparison (RAM versus VRAM), is far more costly.


This repository is for those with locally resource-contraint environments, whether it be RAM, VRAM or CPU and/or GPU [clock rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_rate), and wish to execute their fitting routines in an environemnt with access to more desirable resources without a concern for expenditure associated to renting node(s).  

## Instance types 
EC2 instances with GPUs are preferable as reduce the time need to be provisioning the infrastructure. Here is a narrowed down list of options to choose from 

| Instance Size |GPU|GPU Memory (GB)|vCPUs |Memory (GiB) |Storage (GB) | Network Bandwidth (Gbps) | EBS Bandwidth (Gbps) | On Demand Price/hr* |
| ----------- | - | -- | -- | --- | ----- | -------- | ------- | ------ |
| g6.xlarge   | 1 | 24 | 4  | 16  | 1x250 | Up to 10 | Up to 5 | $0.805 | 
| g6.2xlarge  | 1 | 24 | 8  | 32  | 1x450 | Up to 10 | Up to 5 | $0.978 |
| g6.4xlarge  | 1 | 24 | 16 | 64  | 1x600 | Up to 25 | 8       | $1.323 | 
| g6.8xlarge  | 1 | 24 | 32 | 128 | 2x450 | 25       | 16      | $2.014 |
| g6.16xlarge | 1 | 24 | 64 | 256 | 2x940 | 25       | 20      | $3.397 | 
| g6.12xlarge | 4 | 96  | 48  | 192 | 4x940 | 40  | 20 | $4.602 |
| gr6.4xlarge | 1 | 24 | 16 | 128 | 1x600 | Up to 25 | 8  | $1.539 |
| gr6.8xlarge | 1 | 24 | 32 | 256 | 2x450 | 25       | 16 | $2.446 | 
| g6.24xlarge | 4 | 96  | 96  | 384 | 4x940 | 50  | 30 | $6.675 | 
| g6.48xlarge | 8 | 192 | 192 | 768 | 8x940 | 100 | 60 | $13.35 | 


**Note** the hourly cost. With that in mind, you may choose to run smaller fitting jobs first locally, and using the execution time results to extrapolate and estimate roughly how long it would take for you actually fitting job(s) to complete, therewith gauging how much your endavour will cost.


## Usage 

To start, run the followng script to ensure you have all the required CLI tools: 
```
./check_cli_tools.sh
```
Next, review the `aws_env_vars` file and tailor it to your AWS account. 
```plaintext
AWS_ACCOUNT=project             # the aws account name 
AWS_PROFILE=developer           # the profile name
AWS_REGION=eu-west-2            # aws region 
AWS_TF_BUCKET=project-iac-svc   # terraform state store bucket name 
AWS_TF_STAGE=dev                # state {dev|prod}
AWS_EC2_TYPE=g6.12xlarge        # type of ec2 instanced used to fit, serve and deploy the model
```
Once, happy with the tailored `aws_env_vars` file, to export its content as environment variables run 


```bash
export $(cat aws_env_args | xargs)
```

We want to create a `.tfvars` file in order to make use of it inside of our terraform initialisation. To do so from the command line, run:

```bash
cat <<EOF > $AWS_ACCOUNT.tfvars
name="${AWS_ACCOUNT}"
region="${AWS_REGION}"
environment="${AWS_TF_STAGE}"
instace_type="${AWS_EC2_TPYE}"
tf_bucket="${AWS_TF_BUCKET}"
EOF
```
This will create the `$AWS_ACCONT.tfvars` file which `terraform` will as an input. 


Next, we need to provision the state-store bucket for terraform with:
```bash
./utils/create-s3-tf-backend-bucket.sh 
```
and then initialise `terraform` with
```bash
terraform init
```
generate a plan of the to-be-provisioned resources via 
```
terraform plan
```
and then apply those provisions with
```
terraform apply
```
